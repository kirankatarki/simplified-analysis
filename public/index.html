          Let us simplify analysis! An analyst uses the data you already have or
          acquire while running the business. Data is helpful in understanding
          the business trends, profit generation sources, etc.
        </p>

        <p class="topic-summary">
          Analyst using his skills can suggest required changes to be done in
          your business process to generate maximum profits. Using an example of
          a Car Dealership business, lets understand how lead analysis aids
          company growth.

        <p class="video-summary">
          When we hear the word analysis, all that comes to our mind is numbers.
          But analysis is not just that, it is an investigation of existing data
          and study of business that will lead to profits.<br /><br />
          This is business of a Car Dealership. The manufacturer provides the
          product and its car dealer’s job to sell as many cars as possible. In
          this case, manufacturer sends some leads to the dealer and he himself
          has some sources of the leads. Lead is an individual who is interested
          in buying your product. Thus higher the leads, more is the profit.

        <h1 class="video-title">What is a Lead?</h1>
        <p class="video-summary">
          Lead is an individual or an organization who has a potential to turn
          into a customer. Our goal is to convert all the leads to customers,
          but that’s an ideal world scenario. So in real world, one should try
          to convert as many leads as possible to customers.<br /><br />
          We obtain maximum leads via three sources- Phone calls, Walk-ins and
          Internet. When we see the trend, it suggests that the leads via Phone
          calls and walk-ins have been steady over the years but the leads via
          internet are growing. Thus, we can direct more resources to work
          towards internet leads.

        <p class="video-summary">
          Let us deep dive and understand how the business works and its
          analysis. Leads are obtained by the marketing team and their details
          are provided to the sales team. The sales team then follows up with
          all the leads.<br /><br />
          We know that not every lead becomes a customer, so for how long do we
          follow up with a lead? Conversion rate graph comes into picture. We
          observe that most of the leads convert within 14 days, after 14 days
          of no response there is a low chance of a lead converting to a
          customer.

        <h1 class="video-title">Results</h1>
        <p class="video-summary">
          To determine the results, we classify leads into Won, Lost and Bad.
          Won leads are the ones who have bought the product, in this case the
          car. Lost leads are the ones who haven’t responded well and bad leads
          are the ones with no specific information. Now, we classify open leads
          since we need to work on open leads. They are classified as Added new
          (Fresh leads), Carried forward and Carried forward for more than 120
          days.<br /><br />
          We see that in the Data Management system, the count of Carried
          forward leads more than 120 days is around 800. This means that time
          and resources spent on these leads is high even when their potential
          to turn into customer is almost nil. That is a poor usage of
          resources. So, those leads can be deleted making way for fresh leads.

        <h1 class="video-title">Conclusion</h1>
        <p class="video-summary">
          The analysis helps us understand that the conversion rate of a lead to
          a customer is important. It highlights gaps between CRM (Customer
          relationship management) and DMS (Data Management System) and links
          them.<br /><br />
          Analytics can be used to drive the conversion rate by maintaining
          steady leads flow, managing open leads and creating a desired buyer
          profile. Costs can be reduced by focusing on lead sources which
          generate higher profit/cost ratio and eliminating leads that outweigh
          profits. Thus a few tweaks and changes in the process can drive huge
          profits.
